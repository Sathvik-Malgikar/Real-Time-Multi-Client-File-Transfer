# File Transfer Systems

This repository contains two different implementations of file transfer systems:

## The Multi-Client Mayhem (Enhanced Problem Statement)

This folder (`The-Multi-Client-Mayhem`) contains a reliable file transfer system designed to handle multiple concurrent clients. It focuses on robustness through error testing, concurrency testing, performance evaluation, and boundary/stress testing.

## The Classic File Transfer (First Problem Statement)

This folder (`The-Classic-File-Transfer`) contains a client-server file transfer system with a focus on real-time transfer and data integrity verification using checksums. It includes features like file chunking, sequence numbering, and optional error simulation.
