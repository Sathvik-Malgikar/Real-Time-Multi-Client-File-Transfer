# File Transfer Systems

This repository contains two different implementations of file transfer systems:

## Multi-Client Reliable File Transfer

This folder (`multiclient`) contains a reliable file transfer system designed to handle multiple concurrent clients. It focuses on robustness through error testing, concurrency testing, performance evaluation, and boundary/stress testing.

## Real-Time File Transfer and Verification System

This folder (`simplesharing`) contains a client-server file transfer system with a focus on real-time transfer and data integrity verification using checksums. It includes features like file chunking, sequence numbering, and optional error simulation.
